### Context
Game developed in the 2017 Retro Game Jam organized by IEEE and Porto Graphics.

**Theme:** Discovery

### Info 
I worked as the Game Designer and Programmer for this project.

It was my and my colleagues first Game Jam, and it was an awesome experience.

:warning: We had lots of ideas and, being only 3 guys with 2 computers, were not able to complete all of them. It's an unfinished game which I might take up later.

### Technologies
* Pico-8
* Lua 

### Description
The game's core idea was to find a way to defeat the Cthulhu that is trying to kill you. In order to do that, you would face many problems first.

The player would start in the middle of the room, with limited vision, being attacked by cthulhu (the player didn't know who or what was attacking him until later).
There are 2 different projectiles. The first ones are constant and predictable, spawning 5 in different directions. The other ones are permanent (do not leave the map or get destroyed) and bounce of the walls, getting faster with time. 
It first would need to find a way to augment his vision, to be able to dodge and react more effectively to attacks. After that, it would need a tactic to defeat the monster.

By playing the game, the player would notice that, approaching the walls, Cthulhu tentacles would come out to attack him. 
It would then need to exploit this fact and make the tentacles collide with rocks on the map, damaging the enemy.
One of the rocks would have beneath it a vision orb, which would expand the player's vision.
