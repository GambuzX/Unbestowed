Unbestowed

Game developed in 2017 Retro Game Jam organized by IEEE and Porto Graphics.
Requires Pico-8 software to play.

It was my and my colleagues first Game Jam. The theme was "Discovery" and we had to use Pico-8.

We had lots of ideas and, being only 3 guys with 2 computers, were not able to complete all of them. It's an unfinished game which I might take up later.

Our game's core idea was to find a way to defeat the Cthulhu that is trying to kill you. In order to do that, you would face many problems first.

The player would start in the middle of the room, with limited vision, being attacked by cthulhu (the player didn't know who or what was attacking him until later).
There are 2 different porjectiles. The first ones are constant and predictable, spawning 5 in different directions. The other ones are permanent (do not leave the map or get destroyed) and bounce of the walls, getting faster with time. 
It first would need to find a way to augment his vision, to be able to dodge and react more effectively to attacks. After that, it would need a tactit to defeat the monster.


By playing the game, the player would notice that, approaching the walls, Cthulhu tentacles would come out to attack him. 
It would then need to exploit this fact and make the tentacles collide with rocks on the map, damaging the enemy.
One of the rocks would have beneath it a vision orb, which would expand the player's vision.
